# Performance & Optimization Questions

## Basic Concepts

### 1. What tools are available for profiling Go applications?

Profiling tools in Go:
* `pprof` for CPU, memory, and goroutine profiling
* `trace` for execution tracing
* `go test -bench` for benchmarking
* `go test -cover` for code coverage
* `go vet` for static analysis

### 2. How do you identify memory leaks in Go?

Memory leak detection:
* Use `pprof` heap profiling
* Monitor goroutine count
* Check for unclosed resources
* Use `runtime.ReadMemStats`
* Monitor memory usage over time

### 3. What are common causes of excessive memory allocation in Go?

Common causes:
* String concatenation in loops
* Unnecessary copying of large structs
* Creating many small objects
* Not pre-allocating slices
* Inefficient data structures

## Intermediate Concepts

### 4. How do you optimize string operations in Go?

String optimization:
* Use `strings.Builder` for concatenation
* Pre-allocate string buffers
* Use `[]byte` when possible
* Avoid unnecessary string conversions
* Use string interning when appropriate

### 5. How do you optimize slice and map operations?

Slice and map optimization:
* Pre-allocate slices with `make`
* Use appropriate initial capacity
* Consider using arrays for fixed-size data
* Use `sync.Map` for concurrent access
* Implement custom map types when needed

### 6. How do you optimize I/O operations in Go?

I/O optimization:
* Use buffered I/O
* Implement connection pooling
* Use appropriate buffer sizes
* Implement timeouts
* Use non-blocking I/O when possible

## Advanced Concepts

### 7. How do you optimize garbage collection in Go?

GC optimization:
* Reduce allocation pressure
* Use `sync.Pool` for object reuse
* Minimize heap allocations
* Use appropriate data structures
* Profile GC activity

### 8. How do you implement custom memory management in Go?

Custom memory management:
* Use `unsafe` package carefully
* Implement object pools
* Use memory arenas
* Custom allocators
* Memory-mapped files

### 9. How do you optimize concurrent operations in Go?

Concurrent optimization:
* Use appropriate synchronization primitives
* Minimize lock contention
* Use channels effectively
* Implement work stealing
* Handle backpressure

## Expert Concepts

### 10. How do you implement zero-copy operations in Go?

Zero-copy techniques:
* Use `io.Copy`
* Implement custom readers/writers
* Use memory-mapped files
* Share memory between goroutines
* Use `unsafe` for direct memory access

### 11. How do you optimize network operations in Go?

Network optimization:
* Use connection pooling
* Implement connection multiplexing
* Use appropriate buffer sizes
* Implement backpressure
* Use protocol-specific optimizations

### 12. How do you implement custom profiling and monitoring in Go?

Custom profiling:
* Implement custom metrics
* Use `expvar` package
* Create custom profilers
* Implement distributed tracing
* Monitor system resources
