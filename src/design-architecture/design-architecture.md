# Design and Architecture Questions

## Basic Concepts

### 1. How do you structure a Go project?

Project structure considerations:
* Follow standard layout (cmd/, pkg/, internal/)
* Organize by domain or feature
* Separate concerns
* Minimize package dependencies
* Use clear package boundaries

### 2. What are Go interfaces and how do you use them effectively?

Interfaces in Go:
* Define behavior, not implementation
* Keep interfaces small and focused
* Use interface composition
* Prefer interfaces over concrete types
* Document interface contracts

### 3. How do you handle configuration in a Go application?

Configuration approaches:
* Environment variables
* Configuration files
* Command-line flags
* Remote configuration
* Configuration validation

## Intermediate Concepts

### 4. How do you implement dependency injection in Go?

Dependency injection:
* Constructor injection
* Interface-based design
* Use of context
* Factory functions
* Service locator pattern

### 5. How do you design APIs in Go?

API design principles:
* RESTful design
* Clear resource modeling
* Consistent error handling
* Versioning strategy
* Documentation

### 6. How do you implement logging in a Go application?

Logging implementation:
* Structured logging
* Log levels
* Contextual logging
* Log rotation
* Log aggregation

## Advanced Concepts

### 7. How do you implement microservices in Go?

Microservices architecture:
* Service boundaries
* Communication patterns
* Service discovery
* Circuit breakers
* Distributed tracing

### 8. How do you implement event-driven architecture in Go?

Event-driven patterns:
* Message queues
* Event sourcing
* CQRS
* Event handlers
* Event persistence

### 9. How do you implement domain-driven design in Go?

DDD implementation:
* Bounded contexts
* Aggregates
* Value objects
* Domain events
* Repository pattern

## Expert Concepts

### 10. How do you implement hexagonal architecture in Go?

Hexagonal architecture:
* Ports and adapters
* Domain layer isolation
* Dependency inversion
* Testability
* Clean architecture

### 11. How do you implement CQRS in Go?

CQRS implementation:
* Command and query separation
* Event sourcing
* Read and write models
* Event handlers
* Consistency patterns

### 12. How do you implement event sourcing in Go?

Event sourcing:
* Event store
* Event replay
* Snapshotting
* Event versioning
* Projections
